# Ai-virtual-mouse
This project transforms your hand gestures into mouse controls using computer vision and gesture recognition techniques. Built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe, the AI Virtual Mouse lets you control your cursor, perform clicks, scroll, and drag using just your fingers â€” no physical mouse required!
